## Replication Code for the Paper: *The Demographic and Economic Effects of the Cambodian Genocide*

This repository contains replication files that use **Stata** and **MATLAB** to simulate demographic and economic scenarios, with a focus on Cambodia. The objective is to analyze population dynamics and economic outcomes under both actual and counterfactual scenarios for academic research purposes.

The analysis reproduces the findings of the paper, which studies the long-term demographic and economic consequences of the Cambodian genocide. A counterfactual demographic scenario is constructed to remove the effects of mass killings and simulate population and age structures from 1950 to 2015 using age-specific fertility and survival rates.

These demographic scenarios are embedded in a production function with capital, land, and skill-heterogeneous labor. The model incorporates intergenerational skill formation to capture the dynamics of human capital over time.

### Main Findings

Although actual GDP per capita temporarily exceeds the counterfactual due to a higher working-age-to-non-working-age ratio and increased capital and land per worker, this advantage reverses over time. Persistent losses in human capital and a slower recovery in skill composition result in lower productivity growth and reduced long-term economic development. The skill composition effect‚Äîdriven by the loss of educated individuals and delayed human capital transmission‚Äîaccounts for much of the long-term economic divergence.

### Significance

These findings suggest that mass violence can distort demographic transitions and lead to slower economic growth. This repository provides the full codebase needed to replicate the results and figures presented in the study.

## Step 1: Understand the Data Sources

### Data Sources Used in This Paper

1. **United Nations Population Division (UNPD)** ‚Äì covering the period 1950‚Äì2020  
   The primary dataset is obtained from the United Nations Population Division:  
   [https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/)

   Extracted data include:
   - Annual population by age groups (both sexes) for Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam  
   - Annual female and male population by age groups  
   - Age-specific fertility rates (ASFR)  
   - Bridged life tables (both sexes)  
   - Aggregate migrant data  

2. **Saving Rate Data**  
   Taken from Angus Deaton and Christina Paxson‚Äôs (1999) paper, *"Growth and Saving among Individuals and Households"*, specifically Figure 2 on page 215.  
   Since official Cambodian saving rate data is unavailable, the **Thai saving rate** is used as a proxy.

3. **Wage Data**  
   Based on the 2010 Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey (CSES), and referenced in Humphreys (2015):  
   *"Education Premiums in Cambodia: Dummy Variables Revisited and Recent Data."*

## Step 2: Prepare Data with Stata

**Stata** is used to:

- Clean and transform raw demographic data  
- Construct counterfactual variables:
  1. Counterfactual survival rate  
  2. Counterfactual fertility rate  
  3. Actual and counterfactual migration factors  
  4. Fraction of the female population  
  5. High-, low-, and average-skilled wage rates  
  6. High-, low-, and average-skilled saving rates  
- Aggregate and format variables for input into MATLAB simulations

These steps are executed through a master script (`master.do`), which sequentially runs the following Stata scripts:

1. `Demographics.do` ‚Äì Load and process population data  
2. `Interpolate_Counterfactual.do` ‚Äì Generate counterfactual variables  
3. `ThreeCountries_Comparison.do` ‚Äì Compare Cambodia with neighboring countries (Thailand, and Vietnam)  
4. `CSES2010_Wages.do` ‚Äì Analyze wage distribution using Cambodia‚Äôs CSES 2010 data  
5. `Saving_Rates.do` ‚Äì Estimate saving rates by age cohort

---

**Outputs from Stata are saved as CSV files** and loaded into MATLAB using scripts such as `LoadInputData.m`.

### CSV Files Imported into MATLAB

1. Actual population and fraction of the female population  
2. Actual age-specific survival and fertility rates  
3. Counterfactual age-specific survival and fertility rates  
4. Actual and counterfactual migration factors  
5. Aggregate migrant data  
6. Average saving rates (log and non-log)  
7. Saving rates by skill level (average, high-skilled, and low-skilled)  
8. 2010 wage data by skill level (average, high-skilled, and low-skilled)

## Step 3: Run Simulations in MATLAB

MATLAB performs the simulations, computations, plotting, and table generation.

### Main Script

- `MasterFile.m` ‚Äì This is the master script that coordinates all simulations and visualizations by calling the key modules below.

### Simulation Modules

1. **Wage Simulation**  
   - `Wage_Main.m`: Simulates wage profiles to determine the optimal gamma value and plots actual vs. predicted wages.

2. **Solow Model with High-Skill Labor (ùõ±·¥¥ and ùõ±·¥∏ cases):** 

   - `SolowHL_PiH_GDP_Main.m`: Uses the Solow model with high-skill labor, incorporating varying probabilities that newborns become high-skilled, depending on whether their parents are high-skilled (ùõ±·¥¥) or low-skilled (ùõ±·¥∏).

3. **Malthusian Model**  
   - `Malthus_GDP_Main.m`: Implements a basic model excluding capital and high-skill labor.

4. **Solow Model without High-Skill Labor**  
   - `Solow_GDP_Main.m`: Simulates economic output using a basic Solow framework without high-skill labor.

5. **Solow Model with High-Skill Labor**  
   - `SolowHL_GDP_Main.m`: Adds high-skill labor to the production function and evaluates its contribution to GDP.

## Outputs

Each model generates the following:

- Simulated population matrices  
- Economic indicators (GDP, capital, land)  
- Plots and figures for visual analysis  
- Tables formatted in LaTeX

---

## Final Notes

- Always start with `MasterFile.m` to execute the full pipeline.  
- Make sure all CSV input files from Stata are placed in the `InputData/` directory.  
- The modular structure allows each script to be run independently as needed.
